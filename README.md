# [CVPR'25] Interleaved-Modal Chain-of-Thought

This repository contains the official implementation of **Interleaved-Modal Chain-of-Thought**, accepted at **CVPR 2025**.


## 🖥️ Introduction

Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT) is a novel reasoning concept for VLMs that integrates both visual and textual information in a structured chain-of-thought manner.
Our approach enhances multi-modal understanding by interleaving visual and textual cues, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought:** Interleaves textual and visual reasoning steps for better multi-modal understanding.

- **Generalizable Architecture:** Plug-and-play and applicable to different VLMs.

## 📦 Installation

### Setup

 ```bash
# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/jungao1106/ICoT.git
cd ICoT
mv icot/processing_chameleon.py path/to/your/environments/transformers/models/chameleon/
mv icot/modeling_chameleon.py path/to/your/environments/transformers/models/chameleon/

Modify the following code in transformers/generation/utils.py/GenerationMixin/_sample
 # update generated ids, model inputs, and length for next step
 input_ids = torch.cat([input_ids, next_tokens[:, None]], dim=-1)
->
 # update generated ids, model inputs, and length for next step
 if 'selected_vokens' in outputs and outputs['selected_vokens'] is not None:
   input_ids = torch.cat([input_ids, outputs['selected_vokens'], next_tokens[:, None]], dim=-1)
 else:
   input_ids = torch.cat([input_ids, next_tokens[:, None]], dim=-1)

 ```

## 🔥 Usage
### Data Preparation

Download and preprocess datasets in `data/`:
1. [M^3CoT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LightChen2333/M3CoT)
2. [ScienceQA](http://scienceqa.github.io)
3. [LLaVA-W](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/llava-bench-in-the-wild)

After all datasets are downloaded, update the path in run.py

### Inference


```
bash run.sh
```
